The idea of the project is a "medical" application, that allows to have an online doctor consultation (online chat), look through personal medical history, make an appointments, etc.

Acces to an application must be provided by admin(in work).  

Dcotor can view patients profile, list of visitors, go chatting with patients, set them threatment.

Patient can view doctors, choose free visit time, ask a question to a doctor, view history, etc.

Application uses Thymeleaf, Spring Data Jpa, Hibernate, MySQL, Spring Security(in work). I18n added(not all pages).

To check the database ussage there should be changed parameters in property file (application.properties).

Correct log in proccess will be added soon with Spring Security to identify whose profile is(doctor, patient, admin).
